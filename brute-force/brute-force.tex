\begin{model}{Some Problems and Algorithms}{probs-algos}
Consider the following scenarios:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item You are given a list of $64$-bit integers, and asked to sort
  them in increasing order.
% \item You have a subway map of New York City and want to find
%   the shortest route between two given stations.
\item You are given a collection of 2D points, and asked to find the
  two points which are closest to each other.
\item You are given a set of (positive and negative)
  integers, and asked to find a subset which sums to zero (if there is
  one).
\item You are given two positive integers $a$ and $b$ and asked to
  find their greatest common divisor, that is, the largest positive
  integer which evenly divides both $a$ and $b$.
% \item Given an amount in US dollars and cents, you want to find the
%   minimum number of coins (using only pennies, nickels, dimes, and
%   quarters) needed to make the given amount.
\item You are given a map of contiguous regions and asked whether
  there is any way to visit every region by car without entering the
  same region twice.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5in}
Here are some algorithms intended to solve the above scenarios:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item List every possible ordering of the given integers.  Test each
    one to see whether it is sorted, and stop as soon as a sorted
    ordering is found.
  \item List each possible pair of points, and compute the distance
    between each.  Return the points with the smallest distance.
  \item List every subset of the given set, and find the sum of each.
    If any subset is found with a sum of zero, return it.
  % \item List all possible routes (that never retrace any segments)
  %   between the two stations.  Compute the length of each route and
  %   output the shortest one.
  \item (\emph{You will fill in this algorithm in \pref{q:gcd-brute}.})
  % \item List all possible ways to make the given amount using US
  %   coins.  Output the one that uses the fewest coins.
  \item List every possible ordering of the regions.  Check each
    ordering to see whether every pair of adjacent regions in the
    ordering is also geographically adjacent.  If such an ordering is
    found, output ``yes''; else output ``no''.
  \end{enumerate}

% \item Sort these integers in increasing order:

\section{Brute-Force Algorithms (15m)}

Report out on definitions of brute force.

\section{Closure (5m)}

A lot of this semester is going to focus on approaches and techniques
for doing better than brute-force.  But we will also explore limits:
for example, for scenario (c) we strongly suspect that it's not
possible to do much better than brute force!

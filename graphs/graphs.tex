  \begin{defn}
    A (simple) \term{graph} $G = (V,E)$ is a set of \term{vertices} $V$
    together with a set $E$ of \term{edges}, where each edge consists
    of a set of two vertices.
  \end{defn}

  Above are shown four example graphs.  In clockwise order from the
  upper-left, we will refer to them as the numeric graph, the
  lowercase graph, the Greek graph, and the uppercase graph.  Here are
  some facts about the graphs:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item $C$ and $B$ are \term{adjacent} (aka \term{neighbors}).  So
    are $6$ and $5$.  $C$ and $F$ are not adjacent.  $f$ and $d$ are
    not adjacent.  $H$ is not adjacent to itself.
  \item The \term{degree} of vertex $C$ is 2.  The degree of vertex $H$ is
    0.  The degree of vertex $g$ is 4.
  \item Vertices $D$, $F$, $4$, $9$, $a$, $b$, $f$, $h$, $i$, $j$ are
    \term{leaves}.  No other vertex is a leaf.
  \end{itemize}
\end{model}

Don't worry if you don't remember all these graph terms!  In fact you
should probably try to forget what you think you might remember and
just focus on the information in the model. Part of the point of this
exercise is to help you either recall these terms, or learn them for
the first time.

  Important note: the singular of ``vertices'' is
  ``vertex''. ``Vertice'' is not a word.  Every time you say it, a
  puppy dies.

\begin{objective}
  Students will understand and apply graph terms \term{edge},
  \term{vertex}, \term{adjacent}/\term{neighbor}, \term{degree}, \term{leaf},
  \term{path}, \term{connected}, \term{connected component},
  \term{cycle}, \term{cyclic}, \term{acyclic}, and \term{tree}.
\end{objective}

\begin{questions}
\item How many vertices does the numeric graph have?  How many edges?
\item How many vertices and edges does the Greek graph have?
\item Make a drawing of the Greek graph.
\item If you compared your group's drawing of the Greek graph to
  another group's drawing, do you think they would be identical, or
  different?
\item What does your answer to the previous question tell you about
  the relationship between graphs and \emph{drawings of} graphs?
\item Give another example (besides the given ones) of two vertices
  that are adjacent.
\item Give another example of two vertices that are not adjacent.
\item What does it mean for two vertices to be \term{adjacent}?
\item Are $\alpha$ and $\beta$ adjacent?   What about $\alpha$ and $\zeta$?
\item What is the \term{degree} of a vertex?  Use the term
  \term{adjacent} in your answer.
\item What is the degree of $\alpha$?
\item What is the definition of a \term{leaf}?  Use the term
  \term{degree} in your answer.
\item Which vertices are leaves in the Greek graph?
\item In the space below, draw a graph with at least three leaves, one
  vertex with degree five, and at least one pair of vertices that are
  not adjacent.
\end{questions}

\begin{model*}{More graph terms}{graph-terms}
Here are a few more facts about the graphs from
Model~\ref{model:graphs}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Vertices $7$--$8$--$5$--$2$--$0$ are a \term{path}.
  $2$--$1$--$0$--$2$--$1$ is also a path.  $H$ by itself is a
  path. $H$--$F$--$B$ is not a path.  $8$--$2$--$1$ is also not a path.
\item Vertices $f$ and $g$ are \term{connected}.  So are $7$ and $8$.
  $C$ and $F$ are not connected.  $H$ is connected to itself.
\item The graph with numbers is a \term{connected graph}.  So is the
  graph with lowercase letters.  The graph with uppercase letters is
  not a connected graph (it is \term{disconnected}).
\item The numeric and lowercase graphs have one \term{connected
    component} each.  The uppercase graph has four connected
  components.
\item $8$--$7$--$6$--$5$--$8$ is a \term{cycle}.  So is $C$--$A$--$B$--$C$.
  $h$--$g$--$i$--$h$ is not a cycle.  $h$--$g$--$h$ is not a cycle
  either.  Nor is $H$--$H$.  Nor is $2$--$5$--$8$--$7$--$6$--$5$.
\item The numeric graph and uppercase graph are \term{cyclic} graphs.
  The lowercase graph is \term{acyclic}.
\item The lowercase graph is a \term{tree}.  None of the other graphs
  are trees (not even the Greek one).
\end{itemize}
\end{model*}

\begin{questions}
\item How many vertices can be in a \term{path}?
\item What do you think is the definition of a \term{path}?
\item Give an example of a path in the Greek graph.
\item Can two vertices be connected but not adjacent?  If so, give an
  example.
\item Can two vertices be adjacent but not connected?  If so, give an
  example.
\item What do you think it means for two vertices to be connected?  Be
  sure to use the term \term{path} in your answer.
\item Is the Greek graph connected?
\item What do you think is the definition of a \term{connected graph}?
\item How many vertices can be in a connected component?
\item How many \term{connected components} does the Greek graph have?
\item Is the set of vertices $\{E, F\}$ a connected component?  Why or
  why not?
\item Write a definition for \term{connected component}.
\item Write an ``if and only if'' statement using the terms
  \term{connected graph} and \term{connected component}.
\item What is a \term{cycle}?  Use the term \term{path} in your
  answer.
\item Does your definition for \term{cycle} correctly explain why
  $h$--$g$--$h$ is not a cycle?  If not, revise it so it does.
\item Does the Greek graph have a cycle?
\item Is the Greek graph cyclic or acyclic?
\item What do you think is the definition of a tree?  You should use
  two of the other graph terms in your
  definition.\marginnote{Warning---a tree graph is not quite the same
    thing as a tree data structure!}

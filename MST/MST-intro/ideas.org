Brainstorming for MST activity.

Learning goals:

  - recall MST definition
  - recognize MST applications
  - understand and prove cut property
  - describe Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms

Model 1: MWSS definitions and sample graph. (see notes).

CTQ's:

C/V/D ??
E/Invention/Application

- which scenarios could be modeled as a MWSS?
  - connecting cities by rail as cheaply as possible
  - connecting nodes by network links.  Must be 2 routes between any
    pair of nodes, so any one link going down will not disconnect the network
  - Given a rail network, find cheapest route from city A to city B
  - XXX?

- Find a MWSS for the example graph.

- (Review) What is the definition of a tree?

- Explain why a MWSS must always be a tree.

For this reason we call it Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

Model 2: Four algorithms

- Prim's
- Kruskal's
- Reverse delete
- Some other greedy path sort of algorithm

- Show four copies of the graph.  Try one algorithm on each.
- Which ones do you think work?

Model 3: Cut Property

State cut property with a picture.

Fill in proof of cut property.

Fill in proof of Kruskal, Prim using cut property?

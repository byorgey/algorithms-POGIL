Xavier Xanadu, Yvette Young, and Zaccheus Zondervan are doctors.  They
are trying to decide where they will do their residencies, and are
each considering the same three hospitals: Mass General Hospital
(MGH), the Mayo Clinic, and Arkansas Children's Hospital (ACH); each
hospital has exactly one available position for a resident.  Each doctor
has compiled a list of their first, second, and third choices:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
  Doctor & 1st & 2nd & 3rd \\
  \hline
    X & MGH & Mayo & ACH \\
    Y & ACH & MGH & Mayo \\
    Z & Mayo & MGH & ACH
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

After interviewing the doctors, each hospital has also compiled a list
of its first, second, and third choices:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
    Hospital & 1st & 2nd & 3rd \\
    \hline
    MGH & Z & X & Y \\
    Mayo & Y & X & Z \\
    ACH & Y & Z & X
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Which hospital is Xavier's top choice? \bigskip

\end{enumerate}

\todo{Term introduction: matching, stable.  Formal definition of
  stable matching.}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Suppose we have $n$ doctors and $n$ hospitals.  How many
  possible matchings are there?
\item \todo{How long does it take to check whether a matching is
    stable? XXX needs more scaffolding}
\item Foo bar
\end{enumerate}

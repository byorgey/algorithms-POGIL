\section{Critical Thinking Questions I}
\begin{objective}
  Students will describe asymptotic behavior of functions
  using big-$O$, big-$\Theta$, and big-$\Omega$ notation.
\end{objective}

\textbf{Important note}: although any previous experience you have
with big-$O$ notation may be helpful, I am not assuming that you
remember anything in particular.  When answering the following
questions, as much as possible, try to rely on the information
provided in Model 1 rather than on your memory.

\begin{questions}
\item Based on the Venn diagram in the model, say whether each
  function is $O(n^2)$, $\Omega(n^2)$, or both. \marginnote{$\Omega$
    is pronounced ``big omega'' (amusingly, ``o-mega'' is itself Greek
    for ``big O'', although they meant ``big'' in the sense of a long
    vowel, not uppercase).}
  \begin{subquestions}
  \item $2\sqrt n$
    \begin{answer}According to the Venn diagram, $2\sqrt n$ is $O(n^2)$.\end{answer}
  \item $n^3$
    \begin{answer}$\Omega(n^2)$\end{answer}
  \item $2n^2 + n + 1$
    \begin{answer}Both $O(n^2)$ and $\Omega(n^2)$.\end{answer}
  \item $2^n$
    \begin{answer}$\Omega(n^2)$.\end{answer}
  \end{subquestions}
\end{questions}

Consider the functions
\begin{align*}
  f(n) &= (n^2 + 2)/n, \\ g(n) &= n^2/2 - n, \text{and} \\ h(n) &= n^3/1000
\end{align*}
for which graphs are shown in the model.
\begin{questions}
\item On each of the following intervals, use the provided graphs to
  list the functions $f$, $g$, and $h$ in order from largest to
  smallest.
  \begin{subquestions}
  \item $2 \leq n \leq 4$
    \begin{answer}On this interval, $h(n) \leq g(n) \leq f(n)$.\end{answer}
  \item $5 \leq n \leq 30$
    \begin{answer}On the interval $5 \leq n \leq 30$, $h(n) \leq f(n) \leq g(n)$.\end{answer}
  \item $35 \leq n \leq 450$
    \begin{answer}$f(n) \leq h(n) \leq g(n)$.\end{answer}
  \end{subquestions}
\item Which function do you think is largest, and which the smallest,
  at $n = 600$?
  \begin{answer}At $n = 600$, $h$ is largest and $f$ is smallest.\end{answer}

\item Does this relative order continue for all $n \geq 600$, or do
  the functions ever change places again?  Justify your answer.
  \begin{answer}The functions never change places again.  Since $h$
    is proportional to $n^3$ it will continue to grow faster than
    $g$, which will in turn continue to grow faster than
    $f$.\end{answer}
\item How do you think your answers to the previous questions relate
  to whether each of $f$, $g$, and $h$ is $O(n^2)$, $\Omega(n^2)$, or
  both?
  \begin{answer}
    From the Venn diagram we can see that $f$ is $O(n^2)$, $g$ is
    both, and $h$ is $\Omega(n^2)$.  Eventually, $O(n^2)$ functions
    will be smallest, $\Omega(n^2)$ functions will be biggest, and
    functions that are both will be in the middle.
  \end{answer}
\end{questions}

\noindent Say whether you think each of the following statements is
true or false.  Give a short justification for each answer.

\begin{questions}
\item If $f(n)$ is $O(n^2)$, then it has $n^2$ in its definition.
  \begin{answer} False; \eg $6$ is $O(n^2)$ but does not have $n^2$
    in its definition.\end{answer}
\item If $f(n)$ has $n^2$ in its definition, then $f(n)$ is $O(n^2)$.
  \begin{answer} False; \eg $n^4 - 3n^2$ has $n^2$ in its definition
    but it is not $O(n^2)$.\end{answer}
\item If $f(n)$ is both $O(n^2)$ and $\Omega(n^2)$, then it has $n^2$
  in its definition.
  \begin{answer} False; \eg $\frac{n^3 + 3}{n}$. \end{answer}
\item If $f(n) \leq n^2$ for all $n \geq 0$, then $f(n)$ is $O(n^2)$.
  \begin{answer} This is true. XXX \end{answer}
\item If $f(n)$ is $O(n^2)$, then $f(n) \leq n^2$ for all $n \geq 0$.
\item If $f(n) \leq n^2$ for all $n$ that are sufficiently large, then
  $f(n)$ is $O(n^2)$.
\item If $f(n)$ is $O(n^2)$ and $g(n)$ is $\Omega(n^2)$, then $f(n)
  \leq g(n)$ for all $n \geq 0$.
\item Every function $f(n)$ is either $O(n^2)$ or $\Omega(n^2)$ (or
  both).
  \newpage
\item Using one or more complete English sentences and appropriate
  mathematical formalism, propose a definition of $O(n^2)$ by
  completing the following statement.

  \emph{A function $f(n)$ is $O(n^2)$ if and only if\dots}
\end{questions}

\section{Critical Thinking Questions II}

\begin{questions}
\item In what way(s) do you think the definition of $\Omega(n^2)$ is similar to
  that of $O(n^2)$?
\item In what way(s) do you think it is different?
% \item Using complete English sentences, propose a definition for
%   $\Omega(n^2)$.
\item If a function is both $O(n^2)$ and $\Omega(n^2)$, we say it is
  $\Theta(n^2)$.
  \marginnote{$\Theta$ is pronounced ``big theta''.}
  For each of the below functions, say whether you
  think it is $\Theta(n^2)$.  Justify your answers.
  \begin{subquestions}
  \item $3n^2 + 2n - 10$
  \item $\displaystyle \frac{n^3 - 5}{n}$
  \item $\displaystyle \frac{n^3 - 5}{\sqrt n}$
  \item $(n+1)(n-2)$
  \item $n + n \sqrt n$
  \end{subquestions}
\item Do you think $n^2 \cdot \log_2 n$ is $O(n^2)$, $\Omega(n^2)$, or
  both?  Why?
\end{questions}

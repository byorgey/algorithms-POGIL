\maketitle

\begin{objective}
  Students will describe binomial heaps and analyze the amortized
  running time for heap operations such as INSERT, DELETE-MIN, and MERGE.
\end{objective}

\begin{model*}{Binomial Trees}{binomial-trees}
  \begin{defn}
    A \term{binomial tree} of order $n$ (for $n \geq 0$) consists of a root
    node with $n$ subtrees. The leftmost subtree is of order $0$,
    the next subtree is of order $1$, and so forth, with the
    rightmost subtree being of order $n-1$.
  \end{defn}

  The image below depicts a series of \emph{binomial trees} in
  increasing order. The leftmost tree is order 0, the next one is
  order 1, the third one is order 2, the fourth one is order 3, and
  the final tree is order 4.

\begin{questions}
\item What patterns do you notice?  Write down at least three
  observations.

\item Send your reporter to some other groups to share your
  observations and collect as many additional observations as possible.

\item If it was not already among your observations from the previous
  question, explain how we can make a binomial tree of order $n$ from
  two binomial trees of order $n - 1$. \label{binomial-merge}

\item Assuming a binomial tree is stored as an object containing a
  root value and a list of children (which are themselves binomial
  tree objects), how long does this operation (making two
  order-$(n-1)$ trees into an order-$n$ tree) take?

\item How many total nodes does a binomial tree of order $n$ have?
  Why?
\end{questions}

\begin{model}{Binomial Heaps}{binomial-heap}
  \begin{defn}
    A \emph{binomial heap} is a list of binomial trees such that:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Each binomial tree satisfies the heap property, i.e., each node's value is less than or equal to the values of all its children.
    \item There is at most one binomial tree of any given order.
    \end{itemize}
    Below are three potential binomial heaps (one per row).  However,
    only one of them is a valid binomial heap according to the
    definition above; the other two are invalid.
  \end{defn}
  \begin{center}
    \input{diagrams/binomial-heaps.pgf}
  \end{center}
  \label{binomial-heap}
\end{model}

\begin{questions}
\item Two of the binomial heaps shown above are invalid, and one is
  valid.  Which is which?  Cross out the invalid ones.

\item How many total nodes does the valid binomial heap in Model
  \ref{binomial-heap} contain?

\item Draw a valid binomial heap with\dots
  \begin{subquestions}
  \item 5 nodes
  \item 8 nodes
  \item 11 nodes
  \end{subquestions}

\item The table below displays total number of nodes ($n$) across the
  top row; each column records the number of trees of each order
  needed to make a binomial heap of a certain size.  The number of
  trees of each order needed to make binomial heaps of sizes $0$, $1$,
  and $2$ have already been filled in for you.  Fill in the rest of
  the table. \bigskip

\item What is the relationship between the number of elements in a
  binomial heap and the orders of the binomial trees that it contains?

\item If a binomial heap has a total of $n$ elements, what is the
  maximum number of binomial trees it could contain?

% \item The \verb|merge| operation takes two binomial heaps as parameters and returns a new binomial heap containing all of the values from the first two heaps. If two binomial heaps each have one tree of order 0, explain how \verb|merge| will create a new binomial heap.

% \item Next, imagine that we want to \verb|merge| two binomial heaps, one of which has an order 0 binomial tree, the other of which has an order 1 binomial tree. Explain how \verb|merge| will create a new binomial heap.

% \item Now imagine that we want to \verb|merge| two binomial heaps, each of which has an order 0 binomial tree and also an order 1 binomial tree. Explain how \verb|merge| will create a new binomial heap.

% \item Based on the insights gained from the previous three questions, write pseudocode for \verb|merge|.

% \item What is the relationship between the \verb|merge| algorithm and the binary counter from the \emph{Introduction to Amortized Analysis} POGIL activity? \label{counter}

% \item What is the best-case execution time for one call to \verb|merge|?

% \item What is the worst-case execution time for one call to \verb|merge|?

% \item What is the worst-case amortized execution time for $n$ calls to \verb|merge|? Feel free to use your answer to Question \ref{counter} to support your answer to this question. \label{amortizedN}

% \item Based on your answer to Question \ref{amortizedN}, what is the worst-case amortized execution time for one call to \verb|merge|?

% \item Priority queues have three main operations:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item INSERT: Insert a new value into the heap.
%     \item FIND-MIN: Find the smallest value in the heap.
%     \item DELETE-MIN: Remove the smallest value from the heap.
% \end{itemize}

% Devise an algorithm for INSERT that uses \verb|merge| as a subroutine. 

% \item What is the amortized worst-case execution time for INSERT?

% \item Devise an algorithm for DELETE that uses \verb|merge| as a subroutine. 

% \item What is its worst-case execution time for DELETE?

% \item Devise a constant-time algorithm for FIND-MIN. You may want to make a small modification to the binomial heap data structure to ensure that it runs in constant time.

% \item What advantages does a binomial heap have in comparison to the standard binary heap?

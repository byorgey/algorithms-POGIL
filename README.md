POGIL Activities for Algorithms
===============================

This is a collection of [POGIL](https://pogil.org/) activities
developed for [Algorithms (CSCI
382)](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci382/) at [Hendrix
College](https://www.hendrix.edu/).  Most were developed by [Brent
Yorgey](http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/), with some contributions
also by [Gabe
Ferrer](https://www.hendrix.edu/mathcs/profile.aspx?id=70718).

Background
----------

At Hendrix, CSCI 382 is a required course for the Computer Science
major, taken mostly by juniors, with a handful of sophomores and
seniors.  Before taking the course, students must have as
prerequisites a Data Structures course (which itself has a CS1 course
as a prerequisite) and a Discrete Math course.  In general, these
materials assume that students already:

- are reasonably good programmers, with a good working grasp of
  things like functions, conditionals, loops, and recursion
- understand data structures like arrays, lists, stacks, queues,
  binary trees, dictionaries, and hash tables
- understand basic sorting and searching algorithms
- know basic logic and set theory
- have some experience writing formal mathematical proofs, including
  proofs by induction

List of activities
------------------

The eventual goal is for these activities to develop into an
officially endorsed collection.  In the meantime, they are in varying
states of development, ranging from some that are quite refined and
battle-tested, to some that were written hastily the day before class
and only used once.

The below table shows the typical order, XXX prerequisites, status
XXX more about how status is determined. XXX diagrams status
